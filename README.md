## Project Description

A description of the client scenario that you are modeling describing it in sufficient detail that
makes sense in the context of your data model. This should be reflective of your conversation
with your client
## Data Model

Include a screenshot of the data model. An explanation of the data model including the
relationships between the entities in natural English. Please include any screenshots of any of
the substantive conversations you have had with your client that have informed the data model.
## Data Dictionary
The data dictionary explains the different columns in the different tables including data types and
their roles. Please refer to sample present on ELC.
## Queries
Include a natural language description of the query and a justification as to why each query is
relevant from a managerial perspective (why would a manager be interested in the query results).
Avoid having queries that are almost identical to one another. You may include screenshots of the
query as well as the response of each query. You can also use the code markdown to highlight the
SQL code and copy and paste the results into the file.
To ensure the complexity of the queries some of the things that may be considered include
multiple table join, subquery, correlated subquery, GROUP BY, GROUP BY with HAVING,
multi condition WHERE, Built-in functions (e.g., AVG) or a calculated field, REGEXP, NOT
EXISTS, and more.

You may combine some of the preceding list of features into a single query (still have to provide
10 queries). Indicate in matrix format in your report which features are covered in a query. A
sample matrix is shown in the project guidelines
## Database Information
The name of the database on the MySQL server. Each table should be populated with enough
data so that the queries return a sufficient result set. All queries should be bookmarked through
the use of stored procedures (take a look at the example under Module 7) according to this
format: TP_Qx (where x is to be replaced by the query number).
